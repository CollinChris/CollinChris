## Hi there 👋 I'm Collin

### I'm currently learning how to build Machine Learning Pipelines

I have been a Stand-Up Comedian for 13 years since 2012.
I worked in various fields during this time doing Stand-Up as well, for example, Events & UX Design. 
I am new to the tech industry but am keen to learn and can bring value from the other industries I have worked in before this, because of my experience in other fields, I have practiced
a lot of soft skills that I am confident in, for example, communication, critical thinking, creative problem solving, storytelling, and people skills.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building ML pipelines after finishing some data analytic projects.
- Currently, I have basic technical skills in Data Cleaning/Manipulation(In Python, Power Query, & Excel), Data Visualisation(In Python, Power BI, Tableau), and am learning more about Machine Learning prediction models now(I have some pinned repositories of what I've worked on).
- I've included some soft skills above but will repeat again here, from my previous job experiences, I have developed strong skills in communication, critical thinking, creative problem solving, storytelling,
  and general people skills.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning and gaining experience in the field of Data Science & AI.
