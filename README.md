## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Collin

### I'm currently taking a Professional Diploma in Data Science at Lithan Academy in Singapore, I am building a foundation in Data Analytics and plan to move into AI/Machine Learning afterwards.

I have been a Stand-Up Comedian for 13 years since 2012.
I worked in various fields during this time doing Stand-Up as well, for example, Events & UX Design. 
I am new to the tech industry but am keen to learn and can bring value from the other industries I have worked in before this, because of my experience in other fields, I have practiced
a lot of soft skills that I am confident in, for example, communication, critical thinking, creative problem solving, storytelling, and people skills.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my Data Analytic skills by practicing on my own projects which will be in my repositories as portfolio projects as well.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning and gaining experience in the field of Data Science & AI.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can email me at NillChris.topher@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I somehow feel like joke writing and coding/analysis are strangely related and vice versa, so far I feel like Stand-Up has helped my learning curve in Data/AI and learning about
Data/AI(and practicing those skills so it's digested into my brain) has helped me become a better Stand-up.
